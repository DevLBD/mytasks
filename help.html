            <p class="black">1. How to add a task.</p>
            <p class="description">To add a new task, type something inside the form; then click the "Add" button. <br> The "Save your list" button will turn red, which means that you need to click it to save your list, so you can view them later.</p>
            <p class="black">2. How to mark a task as completed.</p>
            <p class="description">When you completed a task, you can tap it to mark it as completed and it will turn red. <br> As said before, you'll need to save your changes by clicking the "Save your list" button.</p>
            <p class="black">3. How to delete completed tasks.</p>
            <p class="description">If you want to delete your completed tasks, click the "Clear completed" button to make them disappear. <br> As always, the "Save your list" button will turn red and you'll need to tap it to save your changes.</p>
            <p class="black">4. How to delete all tasks.</p>
            <p class="description">If you want to delete all your tasks, click the "Clear all" button to make them disappear. <br> Tap the "Save your list" button to save your changes.</p>
            <p class="black">5. How to edit tasks that are already in your list.</p>
            <p class="description">If you want to change some tasks that are already in your list, double tap the task you want to change and then click it another time. <br> Make all the changes you want, and then click the "Save your list" button or the ENTER key on your keyboard to confirm your changes.</p>
            <p class="black">6. How to use Dark Mode.</p>
            <p class="description">Everyone has his tastes, which means that not everyone likes bright colors. If you're one of them or you just want to protect your eyes, click the "🌃" button to activate Dark Mode. <br> If you activate it, the app will remember your choice and will start using a dark theme. <br> If you want to come back to the bright side, click the "🌃" button again.</p>
            <p class="black">7. How to activate or deactivate Dark Mode based on time.</p>
            <p class="description">If you never clicked the "🌃" button, the Dark Mode will activate or deactivate based on your current time. <br> If you already set a preference, double tap the button and the screen will start to change based on your time.</p>
